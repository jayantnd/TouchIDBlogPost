# TouchID Prolific Interactive Blog Post

With iOS 7 and the iPhone 5S release, Apple introduced Touch ID, a new way for users to authenticate by using their fingerprints to unlock their phones or purchases on the App Store. Now, in iOS 8, Apple provides an SDK for developers to use Touch ID in their apps, and, as you will see in this blog post, it’s actually very simple to add this feature to your app. Remember that Touch ID is only available for iPhone 5S and newer, iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3. That’s something to consider when you implement it in your app.

In this [blog post](http://prolificinteractive.com/blog/2015/01/26/tutorial-introduction-touchid-swift/), I will walk you through all the steps to implement Touch ID in your app — and of course, because we are curious developers, everything in this post will be coded in Swift.
